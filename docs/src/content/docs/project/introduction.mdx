## Introduction

This Test Case Management tool is designed to address the challenges faced by teams in managing and executing test cases with the highest level of **availability** and **reliability**. It aims to streamline the testing process, offering robust functionality, seamless integrations, and the ability to handle large-scale operations efficiently.

## Problem Statement

In the absence of a reliable Test Case Management tool with **99.99% availability**, teams face significant obstacles that impact release cycles and overall productivity.

### Current Issues

- **Application Release Blockers**: The unavailability of the test case management tool infrastructure hinders app releases.
- **High Downtime**: From **October 2023 to January 2024**, there were **~10 maintenance instances** of Testrail, rendering it unusable.
- **Impact on Releases**: Approximately **20% of releases** since October 2023 were affected, with manual updates also failing during outages.
- **Rate Limiting Issues**: Automation suites encounter **API rate limits (180 RPM)**, leading to incomplete test updates and reliability issues.
- **User Complaints**:
  - Frequent reports of slow performance.
  - Multiple bugs in the website impacting usability.
- **On-Prem Plan Availability**: Testrail lacks an **Enterprise Plan** or **On-Prem Plan** that meets the organizational needs, with an **on-prem setup requiring a year-long wait**.

## Solution & Scope

To address these challenges, the following metrics were identified as critical for evaluating test case management tools:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Support for **1000 RPM** to handle regression and day-to-day needs (**300 RPM** expected).
2. **Integration & Open APIs**: Seamless integration and API availability for automation.
3. **Data Migration**: Smooth migration from existing tools without loss of information.
4. **Core Capabilities**:
   - Export, Import, and Create Test Runs.
   - Extensive **DB Storage Capacity** of **100GB**, with scalability options.
5. **Reports and Metrics**: Comprehensive reporting tools for actionable insights.

## Strategy & Recommendation

After evaluating various tools, including paid and open-source options, the following insights emerged:

- **Testrail Cloud Plans** and **Testrail Server Plans** offer limited scalability and flexibility.
- **Other Test Case Management Tools** provide varying features but fail to meet all organizational requirements.

### Recommendation

Building an **in-house Test Case Management Tool** is recommended to:

- Tailor the tool to meet all functional and technical requirements.
- Overcome the limitations of third-party solutions.

## Functional Requirements

The in-house tool should include:

- **User Authentication**: Login and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Organization Management**: Support for multiple organizations and projects.
- **Project Operations**: Create, Delete, Update, and Manage Projects.
- **Test Case Management**: Add, Remove, Filter, Sort, Export, and Import Test Cases.
- **Test Runs**: Execute, filter, and update test case statuses.
- **APIs**: Enable automation and third-party integrations.

## Technical Evaluation

- **Frontend**: RemixJS, NextJS, or React CRA.
- **Backend**: NodeJS, Vertx, or Go.
- **Database**: MySQL for scalable storage.
- **Platform**: Vision, MSD, Delivr, or an independent platform.
- **Environments**: Separate staging and production environments.
