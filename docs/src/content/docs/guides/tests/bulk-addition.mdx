### CSV Format and Uploading Guidelines

##### Must-Haves

- **Title**: Character length must be greater than 5.
- **Section** and **Section Hierarchy**:
  - If adding tests to a specific section like _Upi Whitelisting_ which is in _Account Management > Cash In > Payment Listing RN_, specify the section as:
    - **Section**: `Upi Whitelisting`
    - **Section Hierarchy**: `Account Management > Cash In > Payment Listing RN > Upi Whitelisting`
  - Ensure correct spelling, as new sections will be created if they do not exist.

##### Columns Processed and Persisted in Test Attributes

- **ID**: Optional. If provided (e.g., imported from Testrail), the same `testId` will be used in Checkmate. Otherwise, a new `testId` will be generated.
